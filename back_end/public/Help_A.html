      <p> This is the help section for the warehouse app. Below are a series of instructions of how to use each section of the app; the packing section, and the shipping section. Before beginning any packing activities, it is important the the bluetooth scanner is currently connected to your device. Detailed instructions of how to do this are located in the box with the scanner. </p>
      <h2> Packing </h2>
      <p>When you open the packing section, you will notice that the input for the page is automatically focused to the packer ID. Scan your packer ID with the barcode reader, and check that the name that comes up in the blue textbox is yours. If it is not, then it is likely you have scanned someone else's packer ID. To rescan, select the textbox, and delete what is in it. The rescan the correct ID.</p>
      <p>Assuming that you have scanned the correct packer ID, the input field will automatically be refocused to the packing ID box. When a box is packed, scan the packing ID on the box. This will submit a packed signal with your packer ID to the system. If you do not scan the box when it is packed, your packing will not be counted. Every time you scan a barcode you will notice that it disappears. This is it submitting, and you can keep scanning. </p>
      <h2> Shipping </h2>
      <p> Please see the beginning of the packing section on how to submit your packer ID </p>
      <p> Scan the shipping code from the label. This will submit it to the server and return a list of customisations into the textbox below. </p> 
      <p> Once you have packed the customisations into the box, rescan the packing barcode. This will verify that the box is the correct one for the customer. In the textbox below you will see a success message if it is, and a failure message, with instructions with which box it should be. Rescan the shipping ID, and then repack the customisations into the correct box. Scan the correct packing ID the submit the box as shipped. </p>
